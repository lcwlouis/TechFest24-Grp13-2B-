### Project Description

The project that we are working on is an advertisement generator. The AI Agent is able to use some simple text prompts that the user provides to generate multiple different advertisement images and captions which can help captivate their target audience in order to help increase awareness about their promotions. This will allow users to choose which of the advertisements will suit their product the best.

Our advertisement generator is more than just a tool for making advertisements; it's a dynamic and ever-evolving solution that enables users to create memorable, customized campaigns that connect with their target market and raise awareness and promote their goods and services.
