### Project Idea
Having observed that recently there are a high number of articles online and simple text to voice videos that seemed to be AI generated going viral. We thought we could explore using AI Agents to assist in the creation of advertisements since it is likely that with relatively little effort from the owner, there will be a potential viral advertisement that spawns from the AI Agent. Thus helping the company to increase their brand awareness and potentially increase their sales without needing to spend far higher amounts of money on marketing.

### Project Description

The project that we are working on is an advertisement generator. The AI Agent is able to use some simple text prompts that the user provides to generate multiple different advertisement images and captions which can help captivate their target audience in order to help increase awareness about their promotions. This will allow users to choose which of the advertisements will suit their product the best.

Our advertisement generator is more than just a tool for making advertisements; it's a dynamic and ever-evolving solution that enables users to create memorable, customized campaigns that connect with their target market and raise awareness and promote their goods and services.
