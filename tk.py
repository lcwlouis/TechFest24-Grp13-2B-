Set the scene in an urban environment reflective of Singapore, with recognizable landmarks subtly integrated to appeal to the student demographic. The shoes should be the focal point, displayed prominently in the center of the composition. \n\nDesign the shoes in a way that showcases the variety of colors available, perhaps by having multiple pairs in the background, but keep one pair in the forefront to draw immediate attention. The material of the shoes should have a distinct texture that suggests high-quality, waterproof, and breathable properties.\n\nInclude dynamic, youthful elements such as splashes of water or air bubbles around the shoes to symbolize their waterproof and breathable nature. The color palette should be bright and appealing, with a modern, stylish font announcing \'ShoeX\' prominently. Ensure the advertisement evokes a sense of innovation, durability, and comfort, targeting the lifestyle of active students in Singapore.\n\nLastly, add a tagline near the bottom or top of the image that reads: "Step into Innovation - Comfort for Every Splash and Dash". Make sure the overall styling resonates with a young, energetic audience, looking for stylish yet practical footwear for their daily activities.\n\n---\n\nThis prompt is designed to generate an image that not only highlights the unique features of ShoeX shoes but also visually communicates the brand\'s appeal to its target audience in a compelling way.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1707105008, model='gpt-4-0125-preview', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint='fp_f084bcfc79', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=357, prompt_tokens=140, total_tokens=497))
